# Jokinator
Your #1 Source for Clean Jokes, come see it at 
https://amiedawn.github.io/jokinator/

## Purpose
* To create a real-world front-end application that our team can showcase to potential employers. We are to use the skills and technologies we have learned over the past six weeks, including deployment, interactivity, client-side storage, responsive design, and polished UI.

## User Story
* Given a joke generator, I want to laugh.
* When I click “Get Joke” in the first window,
* Then a random Dad Joke is displayed.
* When I click “Get Joke” in the second window,
* Then the Joke of the Day is displayed.
* When the button to submit your own joke is clicked,
* Then a modal prompts a user to submit his/her own joke.
* When the user enters a joke,
* That joke will be stored in Local Storage and then displayed on @Jokinator3.
* When a button labeled Tweet is clicked, 
* Then the user is redirected to his/her Twitter account to share the joke.
* When the button labeled Follow is clicked,
* Then the user is invited to Follow  @Jokinator3 on Twitter.
